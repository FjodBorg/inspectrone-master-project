Ply_ballast_tank.ply works alright but ballast_tank.ply is bad

Ransac vs Teaser

Knn gpu vs cpu

try out faiss'
FCGF
teaser
Ransac



TODO 
Work on kinect to start with
Pose og faiss
read before working on faiss
Use kinetc groundtruth for pose esitmation

IF doable:
rviz instead of open3d visulization
Continuer pose esitmation (2Hz?) for mynteye and kinect
32 Features in pytorch model


# 23 march
add resume dir in config.py (add translation)

feature distances:
    bad fit:0.101 0.073 0.09  0.079 0.089 0.094 0.108 0.101 0.112 0.122 0.115 0.082 0.107 0.089 0.088 0.096
    good fit:[0.098 0.09  0.11  0.09  0.091 0.097 0.085 0.099 0.086 0.123 0.119 0.093 0.089 0.077 0.11  0.098

look into retraining!
    add rotation around pitch and/or roll together with yaw (line ~87 in data_loader.py)
    Remove scale (we don't scale things here) (line 195)
    Add translation???
shape recognizion (segmentation?)


check fitness (research fast methods)
    Box filtering (around the translated pointcloud) to check if pointcloud fitness is good
    using 'center' points only
    ransac?
    plane fitting? (plane orientation fitting)
    corner fitting? 
    particle filter?
    correspondences?
        Check corner correspondences neighbors to see if fit correctly?
        bag of words (word is histogram of features) approach?
        together with KNN use bag of words? (detecting area/obj) 

        look into papers on bag of words on pointclouds
    
1. fitting (on the point cloud itself)
2. bag of words (fixing point clouds)
3. particle filter (esitmation input into new esitmation)


write a ~1-2 page description of each method
