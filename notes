Ply_ballast_tank.ply works alright but ballast_tank.ply is bad

Ransac vs Teaser

Knn gpu vs cpu

try out faiss'
FCGF
teaser
Ransac



TODO 
Work on kinect to start with
Pose og faiss
read before working on faiss
Use kinetc groundtruth for pose esitmation

IF doable:
rviz instead of open3d visulization
Continuer pose esitmation (2Hz?) for mynteye and kinect
32 Features in pytorch model


# 23 march
add resume dir in config.py (add translation)

look into retraining!
    add rotation around pitch and/or roll together with yaw (line ~87 in data_loader.py)
    Remove scale (we don't scale things here) (line 195)
    translation is not important
    use ransac and icp to make perfect registration
shape recognizion (segmentation?)


check fitness (research fast methods)
    Box filtering (around the translated pointcloud) to check if pointcloud fitness is good
    using 'center' points only check feature points (implment this first)
    ransac?
    plane fitting? (plane orientation fitting)
    corner fitting? 
    particle filter?
    correspondences?
        Check corner correspondences neighbors to see if fit correctly?
        bag of words (word is histogram of features) approach?
        together with KNN use bag of words? (detecting area/obj) 

        look into papers on bag of words on pointclouds
    
1. fitting (on the point cloud itself)
2. bag of words (fixing point clouds)
3. particle filter (esitmation input into new esitmation)


write a ~1-2 page description of each method 


training:
    use ballast_tank as first pcl
    apply augumentation for ballast and scan in rotations
    only consider the paris if it has 80% fitness


march 30:

Find a tool to convert bags to 3dmatch format?
try retraining using new format
ask rune for retraining once it is tested

Store pcd.npy
store color.npy

Overlap ratio needs to be calculated
and text file with all npz files in and combination 
    [pcd1, pcd2, overlap ratio]
